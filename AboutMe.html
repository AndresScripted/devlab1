        <p class="paragraph"> My name is Andres Huitzil and your are looking at my portfolio!
        I am currently in the advanced class for CodeNation located at Salesforce. I am really interested in coding because you can create whatever you want.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> I am also a student attending Thurgood Marshall High School in San Francisco.
        My future plans are to follow the path CodeNation has given me and become some sort of web developer.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> I hope you like my projects!</p>
